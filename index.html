<!-- This page will be the bulk of the project and sort of being the most flashy 
It'll start with a slideshow on the top with maybe 5 photos and having the slideshow
interactive leading to a specfic part on the games page. Under that will explain 
the purpose of the website and maybe some more info below that. -->

    With Every game that comes out, there's it's respective platform. We'll talk briefly here about
    every platform. So to start off we'll talk about Nintendo and the Switch. The Switch is Nintendo's
    newest platform which is fully mobile and can run a lot good games in such a small form. Next we have
    the PS4 which is Sony's staple console. The PS4 is Sony's newest addition to Playstation Console series
    with the PS4 having far superior graphics and power compared to the Switch. Next up we have the Xbox ONE,
    The Xbox ONE is a sort of alight console as it's much more powerful that the Switch, but it's not as powerful
    as the PS4. Lastly we have PC, PC is basically any laptop or Desktop and can basically run any game at max
    settings depending on what your specs.
